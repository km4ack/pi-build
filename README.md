# Description

Build-a-Pi will allow you to get up and running fast with a Raspberry Pi for ham radio.
Rather than downloading a pre-built image where you have no choices in the build, Build-a-
Pi gives you complete control over the build. It allows you to choose the applications you 
want to install and skip the ones you donâ€™t need. This keeps your pi as lean and mean as
possible. A list of applications available using Build-a-Pi can be found below on this 
page. Use it as your base and add additional applications as needed down the road. Videos 
coming soon

# Needed info for pi build

During the install you will need a few pieces of information depending on what you choose to install. If installing all apps, you will need:

For Hotspot:
Current WiFi SSID & Current WiFi Password

For Pat Winlink:
Winlink Password & Grid Square

# Install
This script is intended to run on a brand new installation of Buster. It should not be run on a pi that you have already started installing applications on. Install additional apps that you require after running this script.\
\
Get Debian Buster from https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/arm64/iso-cd/ file debian-10.4.0-arm64-xfce-CD-1.iso

Use a USB flash application such as Balena Etcher, get it at https://www.balena.io/etcher/

Power up your Raspberry Pi, login, and in your home directory, run the following command

     git clone https://github.com/km4ack/pi-build.git $HOME/pi-build && bash $HOME/pi-build/build-a-pi

# Available Apps to Install

#### RTC | Real Time Clock
Software for DS3231 real time clock (Available through update script after initial install)

#### HOTSPOT:
Hotspot is used to generate a wifi hotspot that you can connect to with other wireless devices. This is useful when in the field so you can connect to and contol the pi from a wireless device.

#### GPS:
This will install the needed utilities to get a GPS device configured as a time source on the pi. Helpful when you are not connected to the internet since the pi doesn't have a real time clock and therefore will NOT keep accurate time when powered off. Confirmed to work with this GPS https://amzn.to/2R9Muup Other GPS units may work but have not been tested.
